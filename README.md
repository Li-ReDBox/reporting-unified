# reporting-unified [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eResearchSA/reporting-unified.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/eResearchSA/reporting-unified)
A bunch of small Flask applications for accessing eRSA reporting databases.

The package only works with PostgreSQL because it uses:

* UUID
* INET
* MACADDR

0. run `sudo -u postgres psql -f prepare_db.sql`
0. Update config.py
0. activate env
0. bin/ersa_reporting-prep ersa_reporting.PACKAGE

## Deployment - `ersa-reporting` package

The package can be served by, for example, __nginx__ (proxy) + __gunicorn__.

If deploy on a CentOS 7 cloud instance, [script](centos7.sh) can be used to set up __nginx__ and __gunicorn__.

The packge needs to talk to a database so there is a configuration file for __gunicorn__ to use
which is listed below in the example of __hnas.conf__. It also can be generated by a script like
[gconf_example](gconf_generator.sh.example).

The log of an application is currently hard-coded to be saved in `/var/log/gunicorn/` which assumes `gunicorn` is configured to save logs to there.

An application's log is named as ersa_reporting._application_.log, e.g. __'ersa_reporting.hnas.log'__.

This package contains multiple applications. Main package `ersa_reporting`
expects `config.py` to have relevant settings:
* SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS
* SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
* ERSA_REPORTING_PACKAGE
* ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN


One example shown here assumes package has been installed in `/usr/lib/ersa_reporting` in a virtual environment in `unified_api_env`
and application `hnas` is being served by these commands:

### run gunicorn

```shell
PDIR=/usr/lib/ersa_reporting
cd $PDIR
source unified_api_env/bin/activate
unified_api_env/bin/gunicorn -c hnas.conf hnas:app
```

__conf file `hnas.conf`__

```python

raw_env = ["ERSA_REPORTING_PACKAGE=hnas", "ERSA_DEBUG=True",
           "ERSA_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:pass@host/db",
           "ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN=DEBUG_TOKEN"]
timeout = 7200
proc_name = "hnas"
workers = 2
pidfile = "/run/gunicorn/hnas.pid"
accesslog = "/var/log/gunicorn/hnas_access.log"
errorlog = "/var/log/gunicorn/hnas_error.log"
loglevel = "info"
```

### Biller script

Scripts are using different ways to set up their Flask applications compare
to the main package `ersa_reporting`.

This script is for generating bills directly. It needs credential for accessing
Nectar Keystone. Different to other apps, it takes one extra configure file
defined by the environment variable `APP_CONFIG_FILE`. It should contains
at least these two variables and others to override those in `config.py`:

```python

NECTAR_USER = "username"
NECTAR_USER_PASS = "password"
```

## Development - `unified` package

Tests are run through unittest package. Tests in `unified` need environment
variables `APP_SETTINGS` and `auth_token`. This token is the development
server token set in config file defined by `APP_SETTINGS`. See [example](config.py.example)
for common settings for an API application.

```
python -m unittest usagebydb/tests/test_calculator.py
python -m unittest usagebydb.tests.test_calculator.TestUsages.test_filename_of_usage_save
python -m unittest unified.tests.test_swift
```


### run `unified` package
`unified` package will replace `ersa-reporint` package. To run a dev server
instance, set env variable `APP_SETTINGS`:

```python
# in python shell
import time
import os
os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'] = 'config-xfs.py'
from unified.models.xfs import Snapshot, Filesystem, Usage, Owner, Host
start = time.time()
x = Snapshot.summarise(1452930321, 1452676846)
end = time.time()
print(end - start)

```

```shell
# run Flask dev server
export APP_SETTINGS=config-xfs.py
export FLASK_APP=unified/apis/xfs.py
flask run -h 0.0.0.0 --reload

# run Gunicorn
gunicorn -e APP_SETTINGS=config-xfs.py --access-logfile - -b 0.0.0.0:5000 unified.apis.xfs:app
```
